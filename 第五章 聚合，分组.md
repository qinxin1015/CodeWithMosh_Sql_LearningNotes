# 聚合与分组

### 5.1聚合函数
>聚合函数主要有：
>MAX()
>MIN()
>AVG()
>SUM()
>COUNT()

```SQL
-- SUM()求和的时候会自动忽略NULL
SELECT 
	MAX(invoice_total) AS highest,
    MIN(invoice_total) AS lowest,
    AVG(invoice_total) AS average,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total,
    COUNT(invoice_total) AS number_of_invoices,
    COUNT(payment_date) AS count_of_payments
FROM invoices;

-- 聚合函数内部可以使用表达式
SELECT 
	MAX(invoice_total) AS highest,
    MIN(invoice_total) AS lowest,
    AVG(invoice_total) AS average,
    SUM(invoice_total * 1.1) AS total,
    COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date > '2019-07-01';
```
#### 练习
```SQL
-- SELECT invoices table and Return
-- 		total sales, total payments, 以及这两列的插值
-- 		First half of 2019, Second half of 2019

SELECT 
	'First half of 2019' AS 'date range',
	SUM(invoice_total) AS 'total sales',
    SUM(payment_total) AS 'total payments',
    ABS(SUM(invoice_total)-SUM(payment_total)) AS 'what we expect'
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-06-30'
UNION
SELECT 
	'Second half of 2019' AS 'date range',
	SUM(invoice_total) AS 'total sales',
    SUM(payment_total) AS 'total payments',
    ABS(SUM(invoice_total)-SUM(payment_total)) AS 'what we expect'
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-07-01' AND '2019-12-30'
UNION
SELECT 
	'Total' AS 'date range',
	SUM(invoice_total) AS 'total sales',
    SUM(payment_total) AS 'total payments',
    ABS(SUM(invoice_total)-SUM(payment_total)) AS 'what we expect'
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-30';
```

### 5.2 GROUP BY 子句
- 查询2019年下半年以来，不同客户的总销售额
```sql
-- 1.筛选2019下半年的数据
-- 2.按照gorup by 指定的列进行分组，
-- 3.再对组内数据调用聚合函数进行计算
-- 4.最后对结果进行降序排列
SELECT 
	client_id,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_date >= '2019-07-01'
GROUP BY client_id
ORDER BY total_sales desc;
```
- 查询每个州-城市的总销售额
```SQL
SELECT 
	state,
    city,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
FROM invoices i
JOIN clients USING (client_id)
GROUP BY state, city;
```
#### 练习
- 查询每天刷卡支付和现金支付各收入了多少
```sql
-- Return 
-- 		date, payment method and total payments
SELECT 
	p.date, 
	pm.name AS payment_method,
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_payments
FROM payments p
JOIN payment_methods pm
ON P.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
GROUP BY date, payment_method
ORDER BY date;
```
### 5.3 HAVING BY 子句
```sql
-- 筛选发票总额大于500，且发票张数大于5的客户
SELECT 
	client_id,
    SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(*) AS num_of_invoices
FROM invoices
GROUP BY client_id
HAVING total_sales > 500
	AND num_of_invoices > 5;
```
#### 练习
```sql
-- Get the customers
-- 		located in Virgina
-- 		who have spent more than $100
SELECT 
	c.customer_id,
	c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    SUM(oi.unit_price * oi.quantity) AS spent_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o USING (customer_id)
JOIN order_items oi USING (order_id)
WHERE c.state = 'VA'
GROUP BY 	
	c.customer_id
	-- c.first_name,
    -- c.last_name
HAVING spent_amount > 100;
```
### 5.4 ROLLUP 运算符
- 数据汇总运算符 `with rollup`
- 使用方式 `group by 列名 with rollup`
- 当使用`with rollup`时，`group by 列名 with rollup`的列名就不能使用列的别名了
```sql
-- 计算每个州，每个城市的总销售额，
-- WITH ROLLUP 计算每组的汇总数据
SELECT 
	c.state, 
    c.city,
    SUM(i.invoice_total) AS total_sales
FROM clients c
JOIN invoices i USING (client_id)
GROUP BY c.state, c.city WITH ROLLUP;
```
#### 练习
```sql
-- Return
-- 		payment method, total payment
-- 		及其汇总数据
SELECT 
	pm.name AS 'payment method',
    SUM(amount) AS total
FROM payments p
JOIN payment_methods pm
	ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
GROUP BY 'payment method' WITH ROLLUP;
-- 这里会报错，因为当使用WITH ROLLUP的时候，GROUP BY子句就不可以使用列的别名了
SELECT 
	pm.name AS 'payment method',
    SUM(amount) AS total
FROM payments p
JOIN payment_methods pm
	ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
GROUP BY pm.name WITH ROLLUP;  
```
